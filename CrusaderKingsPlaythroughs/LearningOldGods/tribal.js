		"From the very beginning playing as Miaphysite your moral authority sucks. I don't have any pictures of it at this point, but more of my tribaldom was heresy than not.",

		"Using the religious distaster that was lower egypt to my advantage, I converted to the heresy and used the 'raise tribal army' twice to crush a final alliance of 4 or 5 Miaphysite pocket kingdoms. By this point I had decided that I wanted to make a Merchant republic out of my tribe. These event spawned troops allowed me to fight my way to the sea.",
		"Republic safetly raised, I turned my sights to my neighbors. Unfortunately, they had sighted me first. None of them were pleased with my heresy and a much larger alliance threatened to destroy me. I forstalled it by converting back to Miaphysitism."

		"Ironically, I seemed to have dodged a revolutionary bullet. Alodia and Makuria to the west and north respectively had been felled from within by heresy. This greatly weakened their armies. In addition, now that I was orthodox and they were the heresy, I had a premade casus belli on most of my larger neighbors.",
		"My conquests started with Alodia. Suffering from a recent civil war, my armies easily destroyed theirs and Alodia was mine. I then made a crucial mistake: I landed one of my sons with Alodia. This was a major screw up and would have long lasting effects.",

		"Although I don't have a good picture for this time period, I then breifly, purposely threw the election for Doge and handed over the reins. This is a tactic I find nessesary at the beginning of every good merchant republic.",
		"The problem is thus: A doge cannot declare war or easily revoke trading posts from other patricians. This usually means that you have to relinquish control of either the country or trade at any point in time. With money comes the dogeship so typically you can drop down, slaughter all your trade rivals in the capitol and surrounding areas and pop back up without the country going to hell without your leadership. It also helps if, like I did, after you grab all the capitol trade slots, you murder the doge.",
		"I might as well talk about my leadership strategy for merchant republics. My number one rule is that vassal patricians are not allowed to be landed. I never press their claims on cities and do my best to keep them in abject poverty, scattering their trade routes through events the best I can. This makes elections easy and keeps them from gaining any power which is especially helpful as my patricians for this entire game seems to love heresy, even when my moral authority was higher later in the game.",
		"Although not shown here, I control a fair amount of trade ports near the capitol on both sides of the sea. I also was able to create the kingdom of Nubia. Despite my successes in consolidating my power, in doing so I suppose I ran afoul of the close superpower: the muslim caliphate."
