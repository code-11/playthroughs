		"Third Rule: If you have to assign Kings, make sure they're of your lineage and give them a kingdom far on the peripheral of your lands. That way when (not if) they declare independence, you can happily let them go to mess with your neighbors. Making them your lineage allows for an eventual recombination of the realms later.",

You will be able to hold together large empires, even with the -30 malus given by holding together feudal vassals as a merchant republic. However, your vassals and thus your vassal levies will be very underpowered. Because of this, you will have to fight most of your battles with your own troops. This is no problem for me, since thats what I would do anyway. It also makes it very difficult for factions to achieve the power they need to cause trouble. In a typical game, with these rules, I only get an ultimatum from a faction once or twice."

At one point in the game, I had alliances with the Holy Roman Empire, the Byzantine Empire and the Mongol Empire.

Not only did the Caliphate itself pull at least 30k troops from somewhere (probably holy orders and mercenaries) but almost all of the remaining islamic states also jumped on the pain train, along with all their dukes! Unfortunately, when recording this historic event, the Greatest Doge of Abyssinia accidentally dropped some jam on the documents, which were immediately eaten by the voracious desert flies. Therefore, I have no pictures of the battles. Needless to say I had to call in every troop I had, from all vassal and mercenaries (which given how much money I had, were basically mine anyway).

In addition, my dukes had all become fat and powerful from my Arabian, Syrian and Persian conquests so I couldn't give them any more land. Therefore, I realized I had to make a vassal king.

Stranger still was in the next couple of year, when I see a notification that they launched a crusade against India! Unfortunately for them, two of the empires had combined under a single Hindu leader.

Even better, one of my family members had a claim to the throne. I could have taken it. I didn't for a couple of reasons. First, they had 120k+ troops. A frightening amount.

What is supposed to be a careful balance and constant tension between the families is actually a despotic absolute control by your family. Its basically all the advantages of elective succession without the detriments: You always have a dynasty member succeed, you can choose the most capable one, and you choice is basically absolute because you can just buy the election every time.

Because of this, I didn't achieve my true goal of taking the empireship away from the Caliph which would have been cool (You can't usurp king or emperor level titles as a merchant republic). In fact, because of how the Persian empire is laid out, I don't think I even made it either.",
