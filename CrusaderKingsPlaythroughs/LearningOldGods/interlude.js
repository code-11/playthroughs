		"By this point there are three large indian empires and they would remain relatively stable throughout the game. IMO india is pretty boring and I've never really seen them expand outside the subcontinent.",

Although you get a head start in the trade route race against the other families when you make the republic itself, my lack of money and low trade route cap kept me from expanding...until now. House Darod is being annoying and keeping my trade sectors from uniting."

		"We can see that the Hispanic empire has been build by the Umayyads, and the the Holy Roman Empire has taken or inherited Aquitaine. Interestingly enough (since it shares my religion), Armenia is still around, but upon closer inspection, I found that it was quite weak."
