        <p>
          Internal power had been acheived. I was more powerful than any other single state in Egypt. However, I was no match for the muslim caliphate. Despite several attempts at actual war, it was clear they had almost five times as many troops as I had. However, I was not the one pressing war. I found myself Jihad'ed and no amount of save scumming would save me.
