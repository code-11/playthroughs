        <h2>Dwarf Fortress - Setup</h2>
        <p>
          I recently got back into Dwarf Fortress after a several year hiatus.

          Dwarf Fortress has a steep learning curve, but is very engaging once you understand the system. For those interested in learning, it takes perhaps one playthough of a game in order to learn the mechanics. However, because of how the game works this may take several real life days.

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          I have played dwarf fortress on and off for several years. I actually prefer adventure mode, but decided to see how fortress mode had changed since I had last played.
