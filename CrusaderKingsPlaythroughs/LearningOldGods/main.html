        <h2>The Old Gods - Setup</h2>
        <p>
          I recently obtained the Crusader Kings 2 expansion: Old Gods. This expansion makes pagans playable and pushes the start date of the game earlier.

          Crusader Kings has a steep learning curve, but is very engaging once you understand the system. For those interested in learning, it takes perhaps one playthough of a game in order to learn the mechanics. However, because of how the game works this may take several real life days.

        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>
          This is my 3rd crusader kings game, having played as feudal Castille and a hungarian merchant republic located on the Black sea. At the time of writing this playthrough I have accumulated a shaming 264 hours of crusader kings play time. I tend to focus on military conquest rather than intrigue or diplomacy and commonly <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/scumming">save scum</a>.
