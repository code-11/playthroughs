The biggest threat at this point was the Caliphate, especially since I planned on doing some border wars against Afar. I didn't want their 40K+ doomstacks jumping in when I was just trying to gain a bit of Ethiopia. Therefore, I parked my Chancellor on top of the capitol. It would be centuries before I moved him.",

		"Some of you may ask: 'why not the Mediterranean?' Although I could have easily crushed Venice, the dominant force there, I stuck to the Arabian cost and southern Persia for three reasons. First, the Mediterranean is boring. Second, I wanted to maintain a contiguous trade route. And finally and most importantly, you can't build trade posts in bodies of water which  are unconnected to your capitol :(. Although this is probably maintained for technical reasons, I feel like like this is somewhat ahistoric, as Egypt had a large trading presence in both the Mediterranean and the Red Sea for centuries before Crusader kings even starts."

Before now I had thought of expanding into India for the fun of it, but their powerful empires and relative stability dissuaded me somewhat. Instead, I was going to supplant the Caliphate in the Middle East, totally and completely and try to take over as much of their land as possible. This was pretty  much impossible at this point but its always good to have a goal in unstructured games like CK2"

		"The gamble is thus, if you declare war on a revolting faction, you become hostile to forces of both sides. Furthermore, if the revolt ends (in any way) before you're finished with yours, the war ends inconclusively, which is lame. So needless to say, I jumped them quite quickly and soon they found their countries besieged and conquered.",

As you have seen, I was basically at war constantly from when this character took the throne. But I felt like I needed one more gambit. The revolt wasn't over and the caliphate was distracted with fighting in Persia and Syria. It was the perfect time to expand into Egypt.",
		"I attacked and defeated two ill placed armies and lay siege to the lower Egypt in parallel. All the while, I knew that the Caliphate's doomstacks were collecting themselves. Sure enough, in a handful of years, the revolt had been squashed and they started coming after me. In a nail biting finish I manged to sneak away with 100% war score as the started to move on me. Its not shown well in the picture above, but hidden under the fog of war in Farama is a 20K death army. ",
		"I also used every troop I could manage for this attack. Typically, when I play crusader kings, I don't use vassal troops ever in offensive wars. The negative opinion malus from doing so stacks up very quickly and it already takes a while to collect them from the corners of your realm usually. However, I have one caveat to that rule. If you're going to do a holy war, typically I call up all my vassals. Holy wars have the nasty occurrence of drawing neighbors into the fray, turning something quite manageable into something deadly. So I used all demesne, vassal and mercenary troops.",
		"It is worth noting that as a Christian in this area, you don't get good mercenaries. There are only two bands to call from and they are quite poor, mainly have light (read useless) infantry. Despite this, since I had the money, they were involved."

I capitalized on this opportunity and married off one of my exceedingly useless female children to him. Because females can't come to power in a merchant republic or marry matrilineally, the usual care one should give their descendents in CK2 is in some sense reversed. I attempted to make sure my female offspring had very poor qualities and then married them off to dukes and neighbors I didn't like.",

This time I had a different goal. Alexandria, the nominal resting place of the Miaphysite Papacy had long yearned for freedom from the big green blob. Additionally, my religious authority was only in the 50s, making nasty revolt very likely. Plus I was going to take over northern Egypt at some point, may as well have been now... So I did, and gave the country to the Miaphysite pope, who became suddenly very happy with me! (Not that it matters very much, the Miaphysite pope is basically a figurehead in CK2 since he can't declare crusades."

This was devised mainly for attrition negation, but I believe you get some sort of bonus to combat if you get reinforcements while you're fighting.
