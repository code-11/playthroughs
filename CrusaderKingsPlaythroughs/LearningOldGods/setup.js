		"I attempted to play as several small Norwegian tribes. All met dismal failure.",
		"The struggle with all of these is that at the start, these one country tribes lack the troops to dominate their neighbors to even get the ball rolling. All the while, their southern friends start with multiple countries and profoundly more troops.",
		"The effects of this are clear. Of the 5 or so games I tried, all were steamrolled. I decided to leave the north to the Nords and attempt success elsewhere."

		"In the old gods start, this is the not the case. Although the muslims are still a world power, in southern Egypt, there is a collection of small Miaphysite tribes and petty kingdoms and even a Jewish one! I picked a tribe and had at it.",

		"My final playthrough was started in gojjam. This tribe has the advantage of a two country start, giving you powerful raiding and early domination over the more petty northern tribes.",
		"Before I jump into the chronology of Gojjam's glorious rise to power, let me deliniate some advantages and disadvantages of this starting position. Most of these takeaways are also applicable, I believe, to non-muslim Egypt starts in general",
		"<Religion>-Miaphysitism in game is a very bland version of Christianity. It has a pope like figure, but cannot call any crusades. You can have the Coptic pope grant invasions, but since invasions only work against like-religion targets, and only Egypt and Armenia share Miaphysitism, its bascially useless.",
		"However, it is not without its advantages. Mostly due to your pitiful starting position, you are assured complete control over the religion itself. Having the coptic pope as your vassal allows you to basically devorce and excommunicate anyone at your leisure. However, I did not realize this until far into the game.",
		"Also due to your pathetic starting conditions, you will struggle with moral authority. Two holy sites are nearby, but the other three will take many decades to get. Religous revolts doomed most of my playthroughs",
		"<Government Type>-Tribes are fun to play. Their raiding allows quick money accumulation and a method for reducing the size of enemy state's armies without having to go to war.",
		"I feel like some of their machanics are a bit odd. For instance, their advisors have different abilities, allowing them to call in troops with specialized purpose (raiding, religious). I found that the simple levy action was more reliable than any of the probabilistic one and promptly ignored them. Their random activitation time means that their troops will appear at only the most inconvient times.",
		"One thing I quickly realized is that most of the unique mechanics in the game are tied to religion rather than government type. To be honest, playing as a Miaphysitie tribe is somewhat difficult as the usual Casus belli given to the germanic tribes are unavilable to you.",
		"<Position>-Egypt is a trap. All around you are muslim nations just waiting to holy war or jihad you into extinction. Your only easily alliable nations are those in armenia, which are (in my experience) usually crushed quickly (20-50 years from start) by the muslims. You will get no help from your friends here. I used save-scumming heavily.",
		"Your best friend is the Byzantine Empire. This lovely blob is responsible for taking the brunt of the jihads, allowing you to sneak away border countries while the superpowers are fighting. However, Egypt might be a good start for someone tired of the whole mainland Europe thing and wants a challenge."
