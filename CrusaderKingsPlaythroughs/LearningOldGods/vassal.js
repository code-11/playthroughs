		"Another thing that helped me was the still diverse set of religions in the states, most notably the jewish Abyssinia. Notice also the prevalence of Monophysitism. This heresy would plague my country for hundreds of years, as at this point I only owned one holy site. The closest one, Aksum, was still held by Abyssinia."

		"Noting that the Caliph had decide to declare war elsewhere, I quickly conquered Nubia and Aydhab, and safe enough to try my hand against my larger independent neighbor, mostly to weaken them for an eventual holy site retaking. Despite a decent show of force, they eventually succummed and lost Tigrinya and Semien.",
		"Also notice the no longer independent Hashimid Kingdom. I forget how this was accomplished, but I don't remember there being a large war, so most likely through inheritance somehow."

		"Just as I was kicking the life out of what was left of Abyssinia, I received a interesting notification. It seems like the Caliphate had succummed to a decadence revolt from elsewhere, perhaps related to the change over in power from acquiring the Hashimids. Normally, I would have loved this as it was a great time to re-obtain my independence. However, I also have a second rule in CK2, which is no double wars. Simultaneous wars, if they aren't revolts are very, very difficult to handle. Since I am a conservative player, I stayed loyal. I would regret my decision."

		"Two very interesting things happened from the decadence revolt. Firstly, the Caliphate came under the control of the Muradid Clan, who subsequently decided to move its capitol. I have no idea this happened, but they decided to move it into my own territory! Secondly, this meant they somehow took seven counties from me, without even allowing me to revolt.  "

	[
		"Although I didn't have to deal with decadence revolts myself, I did have succession problems. As you can see in the picture, I accidentally nominated a feudal son. Once again, this causes your entire country to flip to feudalism. Not happening.",
		"Also visible in the picture is whats left of Abyssinia. It fragmented into several parts. I must not have read the Casus Belli well enough, or perhaps usurped something essential from them. Regardless they were now one country states ripe for the picking."

	[
		"Following this there was some confusion with a revocation revolt from Damascus. Interestingly, I decided not to revolt again, simply due to the number of troops the revolt had (not enough). Despite this, you can see that my territory is supposedly part of the revolt. If anyone knows what happened here, I would love to know.",
		"Another thing I'd like to point out is my lack of money. Yes even as a merchant republic you can run out of funds. For me this usually happened right during or right after sucession if I forgot about my temporary lack of income and built something big (gotta get those city upgrades)"

		"At this point I had, through assassination, solidified my rule and felt prepared enough to retake some of my land the Muradids revoked. Their governors were no match for me, but I had to time the attack well. If the Sultan interviened, I would be screwed. Therefore, I waited until the Sultan was busy elsewhere.",
		"Unfortunately, these engagements were temporary and I knew an army would be coming to crush me soon. My salvation came in the form of yet another decadence revolt. Having never played as or near a muslim country in the past, I have no idea about the rules that dictate how many troop as spawned by such an event. But this one was huge (37k)",
		"Although the massive revolt ensured independence soon, their troops were still hostile to mine. Therefore, I had to win my war quickly, without getting near what I will call Muradid's Doom."
